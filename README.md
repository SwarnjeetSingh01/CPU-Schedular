# CPU Scheduler Simulator
This project is a web-based CPU scheduler simulator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to simulate and visualize different CPU scheduling algorithms, which help in understanding how processes are managed in a computer system.

Features:
1.Simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin (RR), and more.

2.Interactive user interface for easy input of processes and their respective burst times, arrival times, etc.

3.Visual representation of how processes are scheduled and executed.

4.Real-time calculations and results display, including waiting time, turnaround time, and Gantt charts.

Technologies Used:

HTML: For the structure and layout of the website.

CSS: For styling and making the interface user-friendly and responsive.

JavaScript: For the logic of simulating CPU scheduling algorithms and interacting with the user interface.

Screenshots:

Below are some screenshots of the CPU Scheduler Simulator in action:

How to Use:

Clone or download the repository.

Open the index.html file in any modern browser.

Enter the process details and select the desired scheduling algorithm.

View the simulation results and Gantt chart visualization.
